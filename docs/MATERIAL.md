# Material UI

Currently using some elements form material UI but considering other options such as styled-components

**Pros:**
* Easy and convenient
* withStyles HOC provides styles to components
* Global theme
* default theme (breakpoints, spacing...)
* Dark mode ready
* Responsive + accessible

**Cons:**
* Pig heavy weight
* Hard to customize
